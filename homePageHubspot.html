        <p>Website development broadly refers to the tasks and processes involved in creating and maintaining a website.
            This includes everything from markup and coding to scripting, network configuration, and CMS development.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-body home-content">
        <p>As someone who's spent countless hours coding and experimenting with websites, I've come to see web
            development as more than just markup and coding; it's an art form, a way of bringing ideas to life. While
            web development typically refers to web markup and coding, website development includes all related
            development tasks, such as client-side scripting, server-side scripting, server and network security
            configuration, ecommerce development, and content management system (CMS) development.</p>

        <p>Can you believe that we're part of a world where over <a href="">5.30 billion people</a> are connected
            through the Internet?
            That's more than half of our global population, actively engaging in research, connection, education, and
            entertainment through this incredible digital universe. Personally, I believe the Internet isn’t just a
            luxury; it's a fundamental part of our daily lives.</p>
        <p>Given the rapidly increasing number of Internet users, it’s no surprise that web development is a rapidly
            expanding industry. Between now and 2030, the employment of web developers is expected to <a href="">grow by
                13%</a>, much
            faster than most other technology careers. It's an exciting time to be in this field, and I'm thrilled to be
            part of this dynamic industry.</p>

        <h2>Web Development vs. Web Programming</h2>
        <p>Web development and web programming sound very similar — and they are. But there’s one very important
            distinction.</p>
        <p>Web development refers to the overall process of creating websites or web applications, including the
            project’s design, layout, coding, content creation, and functionality. It involves using a combination of
            programming languages, tools, and frameworks to bring a website or web application to life. It may also
            encompass project management activities, such as fielding development requests from stakeholders or
            freelance clients.</p>
        <p>Web programming, on the other hand, specifically refers to the coding and scripting of a website, whether
            the front-end or back-end. It primarily involves writing code to handle data, process user inputs, and
            generate dynamic content. A web programmer will rarely, if ever, handle a web development project from end
            to end. They may build a certain section of a site or troubleshoot bugs.</p>
        <p>Understanding this difference has been crucial in my career, allowing me to appreciate the depth and breadth
            of skills required in the world of web creation. It's a reminder of the diverse talents and expertise that
            come together to make the digital world what it is today.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="home-content what-is-website">
        <h3>1. What is a website?</h3>
        <p>Websites are files stored on servers, which are computers that host (fancy term for “store files for”)
            websites. These servers are connected to a giant network called the Internet.</p>
        <p>Now, how do we access these websites? This is where browsers come into play. Browsers are computer programs
            that load websites via your Internet connection, such as Google Chrome or Internet Explorer, while the
            computers used to access these websites are known as “clients”.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content ip-address">
        <h3>2. What is an IP address?</h3>
        <p>I was always fascinated by how the Internet knows where to send data. The answer lies in understanding IP
            addresses. To access a website, you need to know its <a href="">Internet Protocol (IP) address</a>. An IP
            address is a
            unique string of numbers. Each device has an IP address to distinguish itself from the billions of websites
            and devices connected via the Internet.</p>
        <p>The IP address for HubSpot is 104.16.249.5. You can find any website’s IP address by visiting a site like
            <a href="">Site 24x7</a> or by using Command Prompt on Windows or <em>Network Utility > Traceroute</em> on
            MacBooks.F
        </p>
        <img src="/img/website-development_1.webp" alt="">
        <p>To find your device’s IP address, you can also type “what’s my IP address” into your search browser.</p>
        <p>While you can access a website using its IP address, most Internet users prefer to use domain names or by
            going through search engines.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>3. What does HTTP mean?</h3>
        <p>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is what connects our website request to the remote server that houses all
            website data. It’s a set of rules (a protocol) that defines how messages should be sent over the Internet.
            It allows us to jump between site pages and websites.</p>
        <p>If I type a website into my web browser or search for something through a search engine, HTTP provides a
            framework so that the client (computer) and server can speak the same language when they make requests and
            responses to each other over the Internet. It’s essentially the translator between you and the Internet — it
            reads our website request, reads the code sent back from the server, and translates it for us in the form of
            a website.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>4. What is coding?</h3>
        <p><a href="">Coding</a> refers to writing code for servers and applications using <a href="">programming
                languages</a>. They’re called
            “languages” because they include vocabulary and grammatical rules for communicating with computers. They
            also include special commands, abbreviations, and punctuation that can only be read by devices and programs.
        </p>
        <p>All software is written in at least one coding language, but languages vary based on platform, operating
            system, and style. All languages fall into one of two categories: front-end and back-end.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>5. What does front-end mean?</h3>
        <p>Front-end (or client-side) is the side of a website or software that you see and interact with as an Internet
            user. When website information is transferred from a server to a browser, front-end coding languages allow
            the website to function without having to continually “communicate” with the Internet.</p>
        <p>Front-end code allows users to interact with a website and play videos, expand or minimize images, highlight
            text, and more. Web developers who work on front-end coding work on client-side development.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>6. What does back-end mean?</h3>
        <p>The back-end (or server-side) is the side that you don’t see when you use the Internet. It’s the digital
            infrastructure, and to non-developers, it looks like a bunch of numbers, letters, and symbols.</p>
        <p>There are more back-end coding languages than front-end languages. That’s because browsers — at the front-end
            — only understand <a href="">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a>, but a server — at the back-end — can be
            configured to
            understand pretty much any language.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>7. What is a CMS?</h3>
        <p>A <a href="">content management system (CMS)</a> is a web application or a series of programs used to create
            and manage web
            content. (Note: CMS's aren’t the same as site builders, like Squarespace or Wix.)</p>
        <a href="">See why thousands of customers use CMS Hub to build an optimized website that integrates with their
            HubSpot CRM data and full marketing suite.</a>
        <p>While not required to build a website, using a CMS makes things easier. It provides the building blocks (like
            <a href="">plugins</a> and add-ons) and lets you create the structure with your code. CMS's are often used
            for ecommerce
            and blogging, but they’re useful for all types of websites.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>8. What is cybersecurity?</h3>
        <p>There are always malicious actors looking to find vulnerabilities in websites to expose private information,
            steal data, and crash servers. <a href="">Cybersecurity</a> is the practice of securing data, networks, and
            computers from
            these threats.</p>
        <p>The methods used by hackers are constantly evolving, as are the security measures taken to defend against
            them. Failing to understand how your site could be targeted could result in disaster.</p>
        <p>As a result, a basic understanding of <a href="">cybersecurity best practices</a> is critical for effective
            web development.
            You should also carry out <a href="">security audits</a> on a consistent basis.</p>

        <p>My journey into web development began in the vibrant world of front-end development, where I loved turning
            code into visually appealing, interactive web pages.</p>
        <p>Later, I dived into back-end development, uncovering the nuts and bolts that power a website. Learning Python
            and Ruby, I gained a deeper appreciation for the seamless integration of front-end and back-end. </p>
        <p>Whether you’re looking to hire a web developer or become one, you should understand the different types of
            web development that developers can master.</p>
        <p>These different types of web development primarily refer to the different sectors of the profession in which
            web developers can work. Some of these distinctions overlap, and web developers will often master multiple
            types of web development.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>1. Front-end Development</h3>
        <p>Front-end developers work on the client- or user-facing side of websites, programs, and software — in other
            words, what users see. They design and develop the visual aspects, including the layout, navigation,
            graphics, and other aesthetics.</p>
        <p>The main job of these developers is to build interfaces that help users reach their goals, which is why they
            also often have a hand in the <a href="">user experience</a> aspect of their projects.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>2. Back-end Development</h3>
        <p>If the front-end is what users see, the back-end is what they don’t. Back-end web developers work on the
            servers of websites, programs, and software to make sure everything works properly behind-the-scenes.</p>
        <p>These developers work with systems like servers, operating systems, <a href="">APIs</a>, and databases and
            manage the code
            for security, content, and <a href="">site architecture</a>. They collaborate with front-end developers to
            bring their
            products to users.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>3. Full Stack Development</h3>
        <p><a href="">Full stack developers</a> work in both the front-end and back-end sides of a website. They can
            create a website,
            application, or software program from start to finish. “Stack” refers to the different technologies that
            handle different functionalities on the same website, like the server, interface, etc.</p>
        <p>Because full-stack developers require years in the field to build the necessary experience, this role is
            often sought after by companies looking to build or update their websites. This developer's all-around
            knowledge helps them optimize performance, catch issues before they occur, and help team members understand
            different parts of a web service. This comprehensive skill set is typically covered in a <a href="">full
                stack
                developer course</a>. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>4. Website Development</h3>
        <p>Website developers can be front-end, back-end, or full-stack developers. However, these professionals
            specialize in building websites, as opposed to mobile applications, desktop software, or video games.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>5. Desktop Development</h3>
        <p>Desktop developers specialize in building software applications that run locally on your device, rather than
            over the Internet in the web browser. Sometimes the skillset of these developers overlaps with that of web
            developers if an application can run both online and off.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>6. Mobile Development</h3>
        <p>Mobile developers <a href="">build applications for mobile devices</a> such as smartphones or tablets. Mobile
            apps operate
            much differently than other websites and software programs, thus requiring a separate set of development
            skills and knowledge of specialized programming languages.</p>

        <h3>7. Game Development</h3>
        <p>Game developers specialize in writing code for video games, including console games (Xbox, PlayStation,
            etc.), PC games, and mobile games — which means this specialty overlaps somewhat with mobile development.

        <h3>8. Embedded Development</h3>
        <p>Embedded developers work with all hardware that isn't a computer (or, at least, what most of us imagine as
            “computers,” with a keyboard and screen). This includes electronic interfaces, consumer devices, IoT
            devices, real-time systems, and more.</p>
        <p>With a recent rise in interconnected devices as seen with smart appliances, Bluetooth technologies, and
            virtual assistants, embedded development is becoming an in-demand practice.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>9. Security Development</h3>
        <p>Security developers establish methods and procedures for the security of a software program or website. These
            developers typically work as ethical hackers, trying to “break” websites to expose vulnerabilities without
            intending harm. They also build systems that discover and eradicate security risks.</p>

        <h2>Front-End Web Development Languages </h2>
        <p>As I've already discussed, front-end web development focuses on creating the visual and interactive elements
            of a site. It involves designing and building the user-facing side — what you see, essentially, when you
            pull up a site in a web browser. </p>
        <p>In my perspective, front-end development is likely the “easiest” way to begin a career in web development.
            That said, as with any other aspect of this field, it will have a learning curve. </p>
        <p>Here are some of the most popular front-end web development languages:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h2>
            <p>HTML is likely the language you first thought of when it comes to web development, and with good reason:
                HTML
                is the backbone of any web page. It provides both semantic structure and defines the elements of a
                website,
                such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Web developers use HTML to give content a proper layout
                before customizing it. </p>
            <p>Below is the HTML code for a basic Bootstrap button.</p>
            <img src="img/ifram template HTML.png" alt="">
            <!-- <iframe src="" frameborder="0"></iframe> -->
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h3>
        <p>If HTML is the backbone of a site, then CSS is the meat. CSS is responsible for styling the visual appearance
            of a website. It allows developers to customize colors, fonts, layouts, and other design elements. With CSS,
            you can also create responsive web pages that adapt to different screen sizes.</p>
        <p>Here's a code snippet for customizing the jumbotron element in <a href="">Bootstrap CSS</a>.</p>
        <!-- <iframe src="" frameborder="0"></iframe> -->
        <img src="img/ifram template CSS.png" alt="">
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that adds interactive elements to web pages, such as dropdown
            menus, sliders, forms, and animations. JavaScript is widely used for client-side scripting (that is, the
            script runs on the client’s browser, and not on the server that hosts the website). JavaScript generally
            enhances the user experience by making websites more dynamic and engaging.</p>
        <p>Below is a JavaScript code snippet for <a href="">automatically opening links in a new window in
                WordPress</a>.</p>
        <!-- <iframe src="" frameborder="0"></iframe> -->
        <img src="img/ifram template JS.png" alt="">
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>jQuery</h3>
        <p>jQuery is a fast and lightweight JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML manipulation and event
            handling. It provides a variety of functions and methods to select elements, create animations, and handle
            AJAX requests. jQuery is compatible with all modern browsers and simplifies cross-browser development.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>React</h3>
        <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI
            components and efficiently manage the state of an application. React has gained significant adoption and is
            widely used for developing complex web applications with a responsive and interactive user interface.</p>
        <p>These languages play a crucial role in creating visually appealing, intuitive, and interactive websites.
            Don’t underestimate them: A website may have the best back-end structure, but unless the UI is modern,
            interactive, and user-friendly, it won’t be as appealing to a visitor.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h2>Back-End Web Development Languages</h2>
        <p>While front-end developers focus on creating the user-facing elements of a website, back-end developers work
            behind the scenes to ensure everything runs smoothly.</p>
        <p>As opposed to altering the user-facing side, from my experience, back-end development languages help
            programmers manipulate servers, databases, and software that power websites and apps. That makes it a little
            harder than learning front-end development.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the most common back-end web development languages:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>Python is a versatile and more beginner-friendly programming language known for its readability and
            simplicity.</p>
        <p>It offers a wide range of frameworks, such as Django and Flask, that simplify back-end development tasks like
            database management and handling HTTP requests. Python's extensive libraries and frameworks make it a
            popular choice among back-end developers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>PHP</h3>
        <p>PHP is a widely-used server-side scripting language specifically designed for web development.</p>
        <p>PHP seamlessly integrates with HTML and provides powerful features for handling databases, generating dynamic
            content, and interacting with web servers. Popular PHP frameworks like Laravel and Symfony enhance
            productivity and maintainability for complex web applications.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>Ruby</h3>
        <p>Ruby is a dynamic and object-oriented programming language that prioritizes simplicity and readability. It is
            most commonly associated with the Ruby on Rails framework, which provides a structure for building robust
            and scalable web applications.</p>
        <p>Ruby's elegant syntax and extensive ecosystem make it a preferred choice for web development projects.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>Java is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its platform independence and scalability.
        </p>
        <p>It is commonly used for building enterprise-level web applications that require high performance and
            security. Java frameworks like Spring and Hibernate offer tools for building complex back-end systems with
            ease.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>C#</h3>
        <p>C# (pronounced C-sharp) is a modern, general-purpose programming language developed by Microsoft. It is
            primarily used for building Windows desktop applications and web services.</p>
        <p>With the rise of the .NET framework, C# has gained popularity as a back-end language for developing scalable
            and secure web applications.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>Node.js</h3>
        <p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime (that is, the environment where your JavaScript code executes) built on
            Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side, opening up
            opportunities for full-stack JavaScript development. Node.js is highly scalable, efficient, and ideal for
            building real-time applications and APIs.</p>
        <p>Remember, back-end developers need to have a solid understanding of databases, server management, and web
            security, in addition to their language proficiency.</p>
        <p>That’s why back-end development is generally a little harder than front-end development, but it’s still
            plenty learnable nonetheless. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h2>The Website Development Process</h2>
        <p>In my experience as a web developer, I remember tackling projects without a clear process in place. It felt
            like trying to assemble a puzzle without having the picture on the box. It wasn't until I started working on
            a complex ecommerce site that the importance of a structured approach really hit home. The project demanded
            a mix of front-end and back-end development, each with its specific languages and frameworks.</p>
        <p>By establishing a clear process, breaking down tasks, and systematically approaching each phase, the project
            became manageable and even enjoyable. Trust me, developing a robust process is not just helpful; it's
            essential.</p>
        <p>Here are some key steps I found most helpful in my website development process journey. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>1. Form a plan.</h3>
        <p>Before laying pen to paper or hands to keyboard, it's vital to first connect with teams and personnel across
            your organization to develop a plan for your website.</p>
        <p>Here are some questions to consider before your first site draft:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the goal of your website?</li>
            <li>Who is your audience, and what do you want them to do on your website?</li>
            <li>What type of website are you building? (e.g. basic informational, membership, online store)</li>
            <li>What content are you aiming to publish, and at what volume?</li>
            <li>What’s the purpose of this content?</li>
            <li>How will you structure your website for the best navigational experience?</li>
            <li>What’s your budget?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Answering the questions requires interfacing with your web development, marketing, and financial teams to
            determine your priorities and make informed decisions.</p>
        <p>Put simply? It’s much easier to create a roadmap at the beginning of the process than reverting your progress
            at a roadblock.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content create-wireframe">
        <h3>2. Create a wireframe.</h3>
        <p>All good websites start with a blueprint. Developers call this a <a href="">wireframe</a>. It doesn’t have to
            be an official
            document; it’s simply a vision for your site that’ll give both you and your developer(s) direction and a
            place to start. You can draw it on a whiteboard or use a tool like <a href="">Invision, Slickplan</a>, or <a
                href="">Mindnode</a>. </p>
        <img src="/img/website-development_3.webp" alt="">
        <p>Wireframes are strictly visual tools that will help you understand where text and images will go on
            individual web pages. You can use blank boxes and “<a href="">dummy text</a>” to get an idea of how your
            content will show
            up on the front-end. If you're working with a company or freelancer, I'd recommend creating a wireframe so
            you have an idea of what your final product will be.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="" class="home-content Fity-free-code-temp">

    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>3. Draft up a sitemap.</h3>
        <p>Next, it’s time to create a <a href="">sitemap</a> (not to be confused with <a href="">sitemap.XML</a>, which
            is an <a href="">XML file</a> that helps
            search engines crawl and find your site). Just like a business plan gives a potential investor insight into
            your goals and deliverables, a sitemap gives a developer the information needed to meet your vision. You can
            create your sitemap on your own or work with your developer(s).</p>
        <p>Here are a few questions to ask yourself when planning your site:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What individual pages do you want?</li>
            <li>What content will be on those pages?</li>
            <li>How can you organize those pages into categories?</li>
            <li>What is the hierarchy of pages on your site?</li>
            <li>How will the pages link together?</li>
            <li>What pages and categories are essential to your site and user experience?</li>
            <li>Which pages or categories could be removed or combined?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Again, it’s a good idea to consult with other teams within your organization. If you have an SEO and/or
            content strategy team, their input will be critical in the <a href="">linking structure</a> and categorizing
            of your pages.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>4. Build the back-end of your website.</h3>
        <p>Writing code might be one of the more complicated parts of web development, but it’s hardly the only
            component. You also have to build your back-end and front-end site structures and design.</p>
        <p>Let’s start with the back-end.</p>
        <p>The back-end handles the data that enables the functionality on the front-end. For example, Facebook's
            back-end stores my photos, so that the front-end can then allow others to look at them. It’s made up of two
            key components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Databases</strong> are responsible for storing, organizing, and processing data so that it’s
                retrievable by server requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Servers</strong> are the hardware and software that make up your computer. Servers are
                responsible for sending, processing, and receiving data requests. They’re the intermediary between the
                database and the client/browser. The browser will, in effect, tell the server "I need this information",
                and the server will know how to get that information from the database and send it to the client.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These components work together to build the foundation for each website.</p>
        <p>As for building your website, backend developers will establish three things.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your <strong>logic code</strong>, which is a set of rules for how your website will respond to certain
                requests and how objects of your website will interact.</li>
            <li>Your <a href="">database management</a>, which is how your website will organize, manage, and retrieve
                its data.</li>
            <li>Your infrastructure, which is how your site will be hosted. Hosting your own site will give you greater
                control, but it’s much more expensive and requires you to maintain your own server health and security.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>With these components and decisions in place, your website will be ready for front-end development.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The back-end is slightly tangential to web development because you don't always need a
            back-end if you're not storing any data. “Data” in this context means any user-entered information that you
            need to save and persist. Think about logging in to a website. If they don't have a back-end, how could they
            remember your login information? Or what your profile settings are? To get this information, you need a
            back-end.</p>
        <p>Facebook, as an example, needs to know what people are in your Friends list, what events you have joined,
            what posts you have created, and more. This is all "data" that lives in a database. If they didn't have a
            back-end with a database, none of that data would be accessible to them.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, a website that’s purely informational and doesn’t require the users to enter any data
            wouldn’t need a back-end.</p>
        <p>So, if you have no data, you don’t necessarily require back-end development. But that’s not saying you
            shouldn’t learn the basics. You never know when you might need it.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="" class="home-content Fity-free-code-temp">

    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>5. Build the front-end of your website.</h3>
        <p>If you’ve ever dabbled in web design or toyed with a website in WordPress, Squarespace, or <a href="">Google
                Sites</a>,
            you’ve touched front-end web development.</p>
        <p>The front-end stuff is important — it’s what your visitors, customers, and users see and how they’ll use your
            website.</p>
        <p>Front-end (or client-side) development includes a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It also controls
            components such as <a href="">typography and fonts</a>, navigation, positioning, and browser compatibility
            and
            responsiveness. This part will reflect more of your initial site vision and what you included in your
            wireframe.</p>
        <p>As technology and consumer preferences change, client-side coding tends to become outdated much faster than
            back-end development. This is where coding resources (like the ones we’ve included below) come in handy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>6. (Optional) Work with a CMS.</h3>
        <p>Why would someone choose a CMS over coding “by hand” or “from scratch?” It’s true that a CMS is less flexible
            and, therefore, gives you less control over your front-end. However, a CMS is easier to use (you have to
            write less code), and it often has tools for <a href="">hosting the site, creating your website,</a> storing
            user information, <a href="">creating a blog</a>,
            publishing landing pages, capturing leads, and even building an email list. As a result, you’ll be able to
            make your website more profitable with less than half the work.</p>
        <a href="">See why thousands of customers use HubSpot's CMS to build an optimized website that integrates with
            their HubSpot CRM data and full marketing stack.</a>
        <p>CMS options often include plugins that remove the need to write a back-end. For example, there are WordPress
            plugins for ecommerce so that, instead of building a complicated back-end to charge customers’ credit cards,
            you can just use an existing plugin and avoid the need to deal with databases and server-side code.</p>
        <p>Popular content management systems include <a href="">HubSpot</a>, Joomla, Magento, and WordPress — which has
            over <a href="">65% market share</a>. (In this case, we’re talking about <a href="">open source WordPress
                software</a>, not the <a href="">WordPress site builder</a>.)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>7. Acquire a domain name.</h3>
        <p>At this point, your website will have an IP address. It also needs a <a href="">domain name</a>, a memorable
            website name
            that your visitors can use to find your site.</p>
        <p>Perhaps you’ve heard of sites like <a href="">GoDaddy</a> and <a href="">Hover</a>. These services help you
            purchase a domain name and
            <a href="">register with ICANN</a> (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). Most domain
            registrations are
            good for a year before you’re required to renew.
        </p>
        <p><a href="">Website builders</a> and hosting services, like <a href="">WordPress</a> and <a
                href="">Squarespace</a>, also allow you to purchase a domain
            name.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>8. Launch your site.</h3>
        <p>Once you’ve set up a domain name and linked it to your host, you’re almost ready to unveil your work to the
            web.</p>
        <p>But not so fast — there are still a handful of <a href="">things you’ll need to check before an official
                launch</a>. These
            include planning out responsibilities on your team, testing your site thoroughly for any glitches,
            <a href="">optimizing for SEO</a>, and a final check before “flipping the switch” and making your site live.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h2>Website Development Resources</h2>
        <p>One thing I've learned is that continuous learning is key. When I hit a roadblock on a tricky coding problem,
            I discovered the wealth of online resources available. Outside of connecting and networking with other
            developers, there are plenty of resources you can tap into to further your understanding of web development.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-content">
        <h3>Web Development Courses and Classes</h3>
        <p>Whether you want to explore back-end, front-end, or full-stack coding, here are a few online courses and
            classes that I recommend along with many HubSpot developers.</p>
        <h4><a href="">Hubspot Website Blog</a></h4>
        <p>The HubSpot Website Blog stands as a go-to source for both beginners and seasoned learners. With a focus on

        <h3>Web Development Communities</h3>
        <p>Web developers are masters of the Internet, so it makes sense that they’d hang out and connect in
            Internet-based communities.</p>
        <p>According to <a href="">Code Condo</a>, developers join these communities for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Up-to-date information and problem-solving</li>
            <li>Insightful answers, new perspectives</li>
            <li>Tips and tricks for all-level programmers</li>
            <li>Links to resources, talks, and research papers</li>
            <li>Meeting new friends, code buddies, and potential partners</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are a few online communities recommended by our HubSpot developers.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="">Stack Overflow</a></h3>
        <p>Stack Overflow was introduced nearly <a href="">15 years ago</a> and has since become one of the most popular
            programming
            communities in the world. According to co-founder Jeff Atwood, “[Stack Overflow] is by programmers, for
            programmers, with the ultimate intent of collectively increasing the sum total of good programming knowledge
            in the world.”</p>
        <p>Stack Overflow is a great place to go with questions because most of the time, other developers have asked
            and answered the same ones. The forums in Stack Overflow keep you connected to other developers while also
            keeping you informed.</p>
        <h3><a href="">Mozilla Development Network</a></h3>
        <p>Mozilla Development Network (MDN) is known to be more thorough and accurate than other online resources. It’s
            not as much a community as a comprehensive resource and library of documents for coding languages. MDN is
            useful when learning how certain functions work and staying up-to-date on coding and development news.</p>
        <h3><a href="">Reddit</a></h3>
        <p>Reddit is a forum-based community where developers of all levels gather to ask and answer questions. It’s
            incredibly interactive and includes people from all over the world. You can also join “subreddits” based on
            specific topics such as <a href="">web design, JavaScript</a>, or <a href="">freelancing</a>.</p>

        <h3>Dive Into Web Development</h3>
        <p>Jumping into web development has been a turning point for me. This field isn’t just about coding; it’s about
            reshaping the way we experience the digital world. Honestly, if you’re not diving into web development,
            you’re missing out on shaping a huge part of our everyday lives.</p>
        <p>Here’s my take: whether you're boosting your business online or building the next big app, understanding web
            development is key. The field is constantly evolving, and staying on top of it is not just necessary; it's
            exhilarating. Trust me, there’s never a dull moment in web development.</p>
